## Analyzing the Olympics with SQL involves querying a database that contains information on various aspects of the Olympic Games, such as athletes, events, countries, and medals. SQL is a programming language that is widely used to manage and analyze large databases, making it a useful tool for exploring and drawing insights from Olympic data.

Here are Olympic analyses that can be performed using SQL:

- Fetch the details of the all the countries which have won the greatest number of silver and bronze medals and at least one gold medal?
- Which player has won maximum number of golds?
- Which sport has maximum events?
- Which year has maximum events?
